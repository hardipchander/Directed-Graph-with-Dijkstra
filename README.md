# Functioning-Graph
In this project I constructed a directed graph based on the text file given and then the program checks if the vertices listed in a different text file are connected to each other in the directed graph created. For the second part of the project I implemented the dijkstra alogorithm where all the information pertaining to the shortest path of each vertex from the starting vertex is outputted onto the terminal. 

Instructions of how to run the program on the terminal part 1 
./CreateGraphAndTest GraphFile AdjecencyQueryfile  
GraphFile can be Graph1.txt or Graph2.txt 
AdjecencyQueryfile can be AdjacencyQueries1.txt or AdjacencyQueries2.txt  

Instructions of how to run the program on the terminal part 2 
./FindPaths GraphFile StartingVertex  
GraphFile can be Graph1.txt or Graph2.txt 
StartingVertex is the number of the vertex that is input to the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
